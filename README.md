# Forecaster

## Description

Forecaster is a user-friendly web application designed to provide real-time weather updates and a five-day forecast for any city worldwide. Motivated by the need for an accessible and straightforward weather reporting tool to plan a vacation, this project was developed to offer instant weather insights with ease. It solves the problem of having to navigate complex weather websites by presenting a clear, concise interface. Through this project, I strengthened my knowledge about API integration, geocoding, and asynchronous JavaScript programming.
